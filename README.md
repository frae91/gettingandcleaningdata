# Getting and Cleaning Data - Coure Project

## Introduction

This repo contains my project to [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) : ["Getting and Cleaning Data"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning).

There is one script called "run_analysis.R" that contains the code that does the following:

1. Download UCI HAR Dataset zip file to "data" dir.
2. Read the data.
3. Do some transformations and tidying on the data.
4. Write output data to a text file named "tidyset.txt"
